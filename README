Usage:
encode_known_faces(): creates an encoded dictionary of faces in the training folder
recognize_faces(path_to_image): detects faces within an image and identifies them

Running the program for the first time should always be done with the encode_known_faces call uncommented. This creates the encodings file in the output folder. 
Subsequently, the encodings file need only be updated if the model needs to be trained on a new face.

Functioning correctly, the program should display the image passed into recognize_faces with the faces outlined in blue and a label indicating the name of the person identified.
